                          <h2>Hello everyone, my name is Marinus Eigenraam, Iâ€™m 34 year old and currently work as a freelance graphic designer from my house in Vlaardingen. 
                              I am very excited to become a developer and I will try to give you an idea of who I am, what I did so far and why I think I will do great as a programmer. 

                            After I graduated as a graphic designer, I was not sure what I wanted to do and started a study to become a basic school teacher. 
                            Soon after I started I found out this was not what I wanted and took a job and went looking around for something else. 
                            I love helping people, this was the main reason I first wanted to become a teacher, and started a study to become a physiotherapist. 
                            It was a hard study but I loved the material and did well up until the third year. 
                            I had a bit of a breakdown and had to stop to fix this for myself. 
                            Since I was unable to finish the school year I had to start working and found a job as desktop publisher at a design agency in town I lived.

                      <h3>work experience</h3>
                      <h2>As desktop publisher/graphic designer I stumbled across Java scripts I used to automate and speed up my work within the Adobe work-space. I adjusted the scripts to fit my needs but never got to writing them myself because the priority of my work lied at the design and not the process. 

                        As production coordinator I worked with Salesforce to communicate with customers and keep track of their orders. When I noticed the work-space did not fully fit my and my colleagues' needs I taught myself to adjust the work-space and did so for my team. 
                        
                        Both these experiences brought me in touch with coding and drove me to adjust the applications I used to be able to work more effectively. I would love to use and expand my enthusiasm for coding and be able to actually create new ways to use these codes.
